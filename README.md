# Web-Scrapping-Flipkart-Reviews
In this Project, I am using the concept of Web Scrapping to extract reviews about a particular product from Flipkart and show it in a tabular and organised way.
To run the program, follow the steps :-
1. Open app.py and execute it. Now the server is active
2. Now open localhost server ( http://127.0.0.1:5000 ) on the browser
3. Now Search for Product and see its review
